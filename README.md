# Microservices and Distributed Systems
### Building and Deploying Microservices from scratch

Microservices are an architectural and organisational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.

Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.

In this course you will learn how to build Microservices from scratch using Spring Cloud which provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems such configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, microproxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state.

You will also learn about Docker and Kubernetes allowing you to containerise your Microservices and deployment to the most popular open-source container orchestration engine called Kubernetes. Kubernetes offers the ability to schedule and manage containers at scale.
